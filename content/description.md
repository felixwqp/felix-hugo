I'm Felix Wang, Software Engineer.

Building the intent-based-network infrastructure for Google now,
- including network workflow orchestration and config management.

Worked for Akuna Capital to build trading system for FPGA-based execution.

I'm interested in both low latency system and high reliable distributed system.
